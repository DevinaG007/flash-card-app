# flash-card-app
An application for teachers to create flashcards for students to use for studying.

A list of decks is displayed on the homepage, where students can click view decks and their cards. 

New decks and cards can be created, and existing decks and cards can be edited or deleted. When viewing a deck, a student can enter study mode. While on the study page, cards are displayed front-side first, one at a time. Students can then flip the card to see the other side. After flipping, they are able to move on to the next card. Upon completion, they're asked if they wish to restart the deck or return home.
